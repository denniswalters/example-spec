## Spec Requirements

Specs must meet the following requirements:

- Follow the OpenAPI 2.0 specification
- Include an `operationId` for Fortellis to assign a unique ID to that endpoint
- Conform to current Fortellis standards

For more information on the spec, please see the [Open API Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md).

### Swagger Version

Include the swagger version at the top of the file.

```yaml
swagger: '2.0'
```

### Info

Include an info section with the following information:

- Version
- Title
- Description
- Contact
  - Name
  - URL
  - Email

```yaml

#### Version

You must include the semantic version of the spec within the `info` section.

#### Title

Consider the following when creating a spec title:

- You must include the title in the spec.
- Users will see the title that you enter when you are registering the spec, not the title from the spec.
- You should keep the title in the spec and the title in the UI consistent.

#### Description

- Product Name - Root Domain - API Name
- A description of what the API does
- The intended audience of this API
